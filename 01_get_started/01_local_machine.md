# Local machine preparations

Before start we need to prepare our machines by installing and configuring some tools.

## Code Editor

Is opt to you which editor to use, but I'd recommend — [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Follow official guide for your OS to install it to your machine.

## Git

We're going to use most popular Version Control System called — [Git](https://git-scm.com/), but you need to keep in mind that's not only one option. Follow official guide for your OS to install it to your machine. To check if it's successfully installed, usually developers print installed version to terminal with next command:

```sh
git --version
```

## Node.js and npm

We also need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to be able to run javascript locally. Follow official guide for your OS to install it to your machine. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) will be insalled alongside with node.js.

```sh
node --version
# and
npm --version
```
